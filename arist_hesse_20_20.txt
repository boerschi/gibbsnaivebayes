things said named equivocally common name definition corresponding name differs each thus real man figure picture both lay claim name animal yet equivocally named common name definition corresponding name differs each any define what sense each animal definition case appropriate case only
other hand things said named univocally both name definition answering name common man ox both animal univocally named inasmuch only name also definition same both cases man state what sense each animal statement case would identical other
things said named derivatively derive name some other name differ termination thus grammarian derives name word grammar courageous man word courage
forms speech either simple composite examples latter such expressions man runs man wins former man ox runs wins
things themselves some predicable subject never present subject thus man predicable individual man never present subject
being present subject do mean present parts present whole being incapable existence apart said subject
some things again present subject never predicable subject instance certain point grammatical knowledge present mind predicable any subject again certain whiteness present body colour requires material basis yet never predicable anything
other things again both predicable subject present subject thus while knowledge present human mind predicable grammar
lastly class things neither present subject nor predicable subject such individual man individual horse speak more generally individual character unit never predicable subject yet some cases nothing prevent such being present subject thus certain point grammatical knowledge present subject
thing predicated another all predicable predicate predicable also subject thus man predicated individual man animal predicated man therefore predicable individual man also individual man both man animal
genera different coordinate differentiae themselves different kind take instance genus animal genus knowledge feet twofooted winged aquatic differentiae animal species knowledge distinguished same differentiae species knowledge does differ another being twofooted
where genus subordinate another nothing prevent having same differentiae greater class predicated lesser all differentiae predicate differentiae also subject
expressions way composite signify substance quantity quality relation place time position state action affection sketch meaning roughly examples substance man horse quantity such terms two cubits long three cubits long quality such attributes white grammatical double half greater fall under category relation market place lyceum under place yesterday last year under time lying sitting terms indicating position shod armed state lance cauterize action lanced cauterized affection
terms itself involves affirmation combination such terms positive negative statements arise every assertion must admitted either true false whereas expressions any way composite such man white runs wins cannot either true false
substance truest primary most definite sense word neither predicable subject nor present subject instance individual man horse secondary sense things called substances within species primary substances included also genera include species instance individual man included species man genus species belongs animal thereforethat say species man genus animalare termed secondary substances
plain what been said both name definition predicate must predicable subject instance man predicted individual man now case name species man applied individual use term man describing individual definition man also predicated individual man individual man both man animal thus both name definition species predicable individual
regard other hand things present subject generally case neither name nor definition predicable present however definition never predicable nothing certain cases prevent name being used instance white being present body predicated present body called white definition however colour white never predicable body
everything except primary substances either predicable primary substance present primary substance becomes evident reference particular instances occur animal predicated species man therefore individual man individual man whom could predicated could predicated species man all again colour present body therefore individual bodies individual body present could present body all thus everything except primary substances either predicated primary substances present last did exist would impossible anything else exist
secondary substances species more truly substance than genus being more nearly related primary substance any render account what primary substance would render more instructive account more proper subject stating species than stating genus thus would give more instructive account individual man stating man than stating animal former description peculiar individual greater degree while latter too general again man gives account nature individual tree give more instructive account mentioning species tree than mentioning genus plant
moreover primary substances most properly called substances virtue fact entities underlie everything else everything else either predicated present now same relation subsists between primary substance everything else subsists also between species genus species genus subject predicate since genus predicated species whereas species cannot predicated genus thus second ground asserting species more truly substance than genus
