propose treat poetry itself its various kinds noting essential quality each inquire into structure plot requisite good poem into number nature parts poem composed similarly into whatever else falls within same inquiry following order nature let us begin principles come first
epic poetry tragedy comedy also dithyrambic poetry music flute lyre most forms all general conception modes imitation differ however another three respectsthe medium objects manner mode imitation being each case distinct
persons conscious art mere habit imitate represent various objects medium colour form again voice arts above mentioned taken whole imitation produced rhythm language harmony either singly combined
thus music flute lyre harmony rhythm alone employed also other arts such shepherds pipe essentially similar dancing rhythm alone used without harmony even dancing imitates character emotion action rhythmical movement
another art imitates means language alone either prose versewhich verse again either combine different metres consist kindbut hitherto been without name common term could apply mimes sophron xenarchus socratic dialogues hand other poetic imitations iambic elegiac any similar metre people do indeed add word maker poet name metre speak elegiac poets epic hexameter poets imitation makes poet verse entitles all indiscriminately name even treatise medicine natural science brought out verse name poet custom given author yet homer empedocles nothing common metre would right call poet other physicist rather than poet same principle even writer poetic imitation combine all metres chaeremon did centaur medley composed metres all kinds bring too under general term poet much distinctions
again some arts employ all means above mentioned namely rhythm tune metre such dithyrambic nomic poetry also tragedy comedy between difference first two cases means all employed combination latter now means employed now another
such differences arts respect medium imitation
since objects imitation men action men must either higher lower type moral character mainly answers divisions goodness badness being distinguishing marks moral differences follows must represent men either better than real life worse same painting polygnotus depicted men nobler than pauson less noble dionysius drew true life
now evident each modes imitation above mentioned exhibit differences become distinct kind imitating objects thus distinct such diversities found even dancing fluteplaying lyreplaying again language whether prose verse unaccompanied music homer example makes men better than cleophon hegemon thasian inventor parodies nicochares author deiliad worse than same thing holds good dithyrambs nomes here too portray different types timotheus philoxenus differed representing cyclopes same distinction marks off tragedy comedy comedy aims representing men worse tragedy better than actual life
still third differencethe manner each objects imitated medium being same objects same poet imitate narrationin case either take another personality homer does speak own person unchangedor present all characters living moving before us
said beginning three differences distinguish artistic imitationthe medium objects manner point view sophocles imitator same kind homerfor both imitate higher types character another point view same kind aristophanesfor both imitate persons acting doing hence some say name drama given such poems representing action same reason dorians claim invention both tragedy comedy claim comedy put forward megariansnot only greece proper allege originated under democracy also megarians sicily poet epicharmus much earlier than chionides magnes belonged country tragedy too claimed certain dorians peloponnese each case appeal evidence language outlying villages say called kappa omega mu alpha iota athenians delta eta mu iota assume comedians named kappa omega mu alpha zeta epsilon iota nu revel because wandered village village kappa alpha tau alpha / kappa omega mu alpha sigma being excluded contemptuously city add also dorian word doing delta rho alpha nu athenian pi rho alpha tau tau epsilon iota nu
suffice number nature various modes imitation
poetry general seems sprung two causes each lying deep nature first instinct imitation implanted man childhood difference between other animals being most imitative living creatures imitation learns earliest lessons less universal pleasure felt things imitated evidence facts experience objects themselves view pain delight contemplate reproduced minute fidelity such forms most ignoble animals dead bodies cause again learn gives liveliest pleasure only philosophers men general whose capacity however learning more limited thus reason why men enjoy seeing likeness contemplating find themselves learning inferring saying perhaps ah happen seen original pleasure due imitation such execution colouring some such other cause
imitation instinct nature next instinct harmony rhythm metres being manifestly sections rhythm persons therefore starting natural gift developed degrees special aptitudes till rude improvisations gave birth poetry
poetry now diverged two directions according individual character writers graver spirits imitated noble actions actions good men more trivial sort imitated actions meaner persons first composing satires former did hymns gods praises famous men poem satirical kind cannot indeed put down any author earlier than homer many such writers probably homer onward instances citedhis own margites example other similar compositions appropriate metre also here introduced hence measure still called iambic lampooning measure being people lampooned another thus older poets distinguished writers heroic lampooning verse
serious style homer preeminent among poets alone combined dramatic form excellence imitation too first laid down main lines comedy dramatising ludicrous instead writing personal satire margites bears same relation comedy iliad odyssey do tragedy tragedy comedy came light two classes poets still followed natural bent lampooners became writers comedy epic poets succeeded tragedians since drama larger higher form art
whether tragedy yet perfected its proper types whether judged itself relation also audiencethis raises another question tragedyas also comedywas first mere improvisation originated authors dithyramb other phallic songs still use many cities tragedy advanced slow degrees each new element showed itself turn developed having passed many changes found its natural form stopped
aeschylus first introduced second actor diminished importance chorus assigned leading part dialogue sophocles raised number actors three added scenepainting moreover till late short plot discarded greater compass grotesque diction earlier satyric form stately manner tragedy iambic measure replaced trochaic tetrameter originally employed poetry satyric order greater affinities dancing once dialogue come nature discovered appropriate measure iambic all measures most colloquial see fact conversational speech runs into iambic lines more frequently than into any other kind verse rarely into hexameters only drop colloquial intonation additions number episodes acts other accessories tradition tells must taken already described discuss detail would doubtless large undertaking
comedy said imitation characters lower type however full sense word bad ludicrous being merely subdivision ugly consists some defect ugliness painful destructive take obvious example comic mask ugly distorted does imply pain
successive changes tragedy passed authors changes well known whereas comedy history because first treated seriously late before archon granted comic chorus poet performers till voluntary comedy already taken definite shape comic poets distinctively called heard furnished masks prologues increased number actorsthese other similar details remain unknown plot came originally sicily athenian writers crates first abandoning iambic lampooning form generalised themes plots
shade house sunshine riverbank near boats shade salwood forest shade fig tree where siddhartha grew up handsome son brahman young falcon together friend govinda son brahman sun tanned light shoulders banks river bathing performing sacred ablutions sacred offerings mango grove shade poured into black eyes playing boy mother sang sacred offerings made father scholar taught wise men talked long time siddhartha been partaking discussions wise men practising debate govinda practising govinda art reflection service meditation already knew how speak om silently word words speak silently into while inhaling speak silently out while exhaling all concentration soul forehead surrounded glow clearthinking spirit already knew feel atman depths being indestructible universe
joy leapt fathers heart son quick learn thirsty knowledge saw growing up become great wise man priest prince among brahmans
bliss leapt mothers breast saw saw walking saw sit down get up siddhartha strong handsome walking slender legs greeting perfect respect
love touched hearts brahmans young daughters siddhartha walked lanes town luminous forehead eye king slim hips
more than all others loved govinda friend son brahman loved siddharthas eye sweet voice loved walk perfect decency movements loved everything siddhartha did said what loved most spirit transcendent fiery thoughts ardent high calling govinda knew would become common brahman lazy official charge offerings greedy merchant magic spells vain vacuous speaker mean deceitful priest also decent stupid sheep herd many govinda well did want become tens thousands brahmans wanted follow siddhartha beloved splendid days come siddhartha would become god would join glorious govinda wanted follow friend companion servant spearcarrier shadow
siddhartha thus loved everyone source joy everybody delight all
siddhartha source joy found delight walking rosy paths fig tree garden sitting bluish shade grove contemplation washing limbs daily bath repentance sacrificing dim shade mango forest gestures perfect decency everyones love joy still lacked all joy heart dreams restless thoughts came into mind flowing water river sparkling stars night melting beams sun dreams came restlessness soul fuming sacrifices breathing forth verses rigveda being infused into drop drop teachings old brahmans
siddhartha started nurse discontent started feel love father love mother also love friend govinda would bring joy ever ever would nurse feed satisfy started suspect venerable father other teachers wise brahmans already revealed most best wisdom already filled expecting vessel richness vessel full spirit content soul calm heart satisfied ablutions good water did wash off sin did heal spirits thirst did relieve fear heart sacrifices invocation gods excellentbut all did sacrifices give happy fortune what about gods really prajapati created world atman only singular gods creations created like subject time mortal therefore good right meaningful highest occupation make offerings gods whom else offerings made else worshipped only atman where atman found where did reside where did eternal heart beat where else ones own self its innermost part its indestructible part everyone where where self innermost part ultimate part flesh bone neither thought nor consciousness thus wisest ones taught where where reach place self myself atman another way worthwhile looking alas nobody showed way nobody knew father teachers wise men holy sacrificial songs knew everything brahmans holy books knew everything taken care everything more than everything creation world origin speech food inhaling exhaling arrangement senses acts gods knew infinitely muchbut valuable know all knowing only thing most important thing solely important thing
surely many verses holy books particularly upanishades samaveda spoke innermost ultimate thing wonderful verses your soul whole world written written man sleep deep sleep would meet innermost part would reside atman marvellous wisdom verses all knowledge wisest ones been collected here magic words pure honey collected bees looked down upon tremendous amount enlightenment lay here collected preserved innumerable generations wise brahmans where brahmans where priests where wise men penitents succeeded just knowing deepest all knowledge also live where knowledgeable wove spell bring familiarity atman out sleep into state being awake into life into every step way into word deed siddhartha knew many venerable brahmans chiefly father pure scholar most venerable father admired quiet noble manners pure life wise words delicate noble thoughts lived behind its brow even knew much did live blissfulness did peace also just searching man thirsty man did again again drink holy sources thirsty man offerings books disputes brahmans why did irreproachable wash off sins every day strive cleansing every day over over every day atman did pristine source spring heart found pristine source ones own self possessed everything else searching detour getting lost
thus siddharthas thoughts thirst suffering
often spoke chandogyaupanishad words truly name brahman satyamverily knows such thing enter heavenly world every day often seemed near heavenly world never reached completely never quenched ultimate thirst among all wise wisest men knew whose instructions received among all reached completely heavenly world quenched completely eternal thirst
govinda siddhartha spoke friend govinda dear come under banyan tree lets practise meditation
went banyan tree sat down siddhartha right here govinda twenty paces away while putting down ready speak om siddhartha repeated murmuring verse
om bow arrow soul brahman arrows target incessantly hit
usual time exercise meditation passed govinda rose evening come time perform evenings ablution called siddharthas name siddhartha did answer siddhartha sat lost thought eyes rigidly focused towards distant target tip tongue protruding little between teeth seemed breathe thus sat wrapped up contemplation thinking om soul sent brahman arrow
once samanas travelled siddharthas town ascetics pilgrimage three skinny withered men neither old nor young dusty bloody shoulders almost naked scorched sun surrounded loneliness strangers enemies world strangers lank jackals realm humans behind blew hot scent quiet passion destructive service merciless selfdenial
evening hour contemplation siddhartha spoke govinda early tomorrow morning friend siddhartha go samanas become samana
govinda turned pale heard words read decision motionless face friend unstoppable like arrow shot bow soon first glance govinda realized now beginning now siddhartha taking own way now fate beginning sprout own turned pale like dry bananaskin
o siddhartha exclaimed your father permit do
siddhartha looked over just waking up arrowfast read govindas soul read fear read submission
things said named equivocally common name definition corresponding name differs each thus real man figure picture both lay claim name animal yet equivocally named common name definition corresponding name differs each any define what sense each animal definition case appropriate case only
other hand things said named univocally both name definition answering name common man ox both animal univocally named inasmuch only name also definition same both cases man state what sense each animal statement case would identical other
things said named derivatively derive name some other name differ termination thus grammarian derives name word grammar courageous man word courage
forms speech either simple composite examples latter such expressions man runs man wins former man ox runs wins
things themselves some predicable subject never present subject thus man predicable individual man never present subject
being present subject do mean present parts present whole being incapable existence apart said subject
some things again present subject never predicable subject instance certain point grammatical knowledge present mind predicable any subject again certain whiteness present body colour requires material basis yet never predicable anything
other things again both predicable subject present subject thus while knowledge present human mind predicable grammar
lastly class things neither present subject nor predicable subject such individual man individual horse speak more generally individual character unit never predicable subject yet some cases nothing prevent such being present subject thus certain point grammatical knowledge present subject
thing predicated another all predicable predicate predicable also subject thus man predicated individual man animal predicated man therefore predicable individual man also individual man both man animal
genera different coordinate differentiae themselves different kind take instance genus animal genus knowledge feet twofooted winged aquatic differentiae animal species knowledge distinguished same differentiae species knowledge does differ another being twofooted
where genus subordinate another nothing prevent having same differentiae greater class predicated lesser all differentiae predicate differentiae also subject
expressions way composite signify substance quantity quality relation place time position state action affection sketch meaning roughly examples substance man horse quantity such terms two cubits long three cubits long quality such attributes white grammatical double half greater fall under category relation market place lyceum under place yesterday last year under time lying sitting terms indicating position shod armed state lance cauterize action lanced cauterized affection
terms itself involves affirmation combination such terms positive negative statements arise every assertion must admitted either true false whereas expressions any way composite such man white runs wins cannot either true false
substance truest primary most definite sense word neither predicable subject nor present subject instance individual man horse secondary sense things called substances within species primary substances included also genera include species instance individual man included species man genus species belongs animal thereforethat say species man genus animalare termed secondary substances
plain what been said both name definition predicate must predicable subject instance man predicted individual man now case name species man applied individual use term man describing individual definition man also predicated individual man individual man both man animal thus both name definition species predicable individual
regard other hand things present subject generally case neither name nor definition predicable present however definition never predicable nothing certain cases prevent name being used instance white being present body predicated present body called white definition however colour white never predicable body
everything except primary substances either predicable primary substance present primary substance becomes evident reference particular instances occur animal predicated species man therefore individual man individual man whom could predicated could predicated species man all again colour present body therefore individual bodies individual body present could present body all thus everything except primary substances either predicated primary substances present last did exist would impossible anything else exist
secondary substances species more truly substance than genus being more nearly related primary substance any render account what primary substance would render more instructive account more proper subject stating species than stating genus thus would give more instructive account individual man stating man than stating animal former description peculiar individual greater degree while latter too general again man gives account nature individual tree give more instructive account mentioning species tree than mentioning genus plant
moreover primary substances most properly called substances virtue fact entities underlie everything else everything else either predicated present now same relation subsists between primary substance everything else subsists also between species genus species genus subject predicate since genus predicated species whereas species cannot predicated genus thus second ground asserting species more truly substance than genus
